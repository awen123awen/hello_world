# hello_world
It was Suen's first attempt to create a new repository
This is my first attemp to creat a new repository .
But I get tow questions .
First , I can't tell where to find my main branch .
Second , I don't know what it means that "using different Markdown elements".
I even don't why me must use it.
Now I commit this changes to record my first explore in Git Hub.
It is really intresting for a freshmen of computer.
